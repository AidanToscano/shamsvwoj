TL;DR
    - Who's better, Woj or Shams?
    - Twitter Webscraper
    - Live graph of GOAT NBA insider


It is a well known fact that the two reporting giants that break all the trades and draft picks that go down in the NBA are Adrian Wojnarowski 
and Shams Charania. This has caused much of NBA twitter to take different sides as to who is the better reporter (who breaks the news first).
I decided to take it upon myself to see just who breaks the news first and stack up their "wins" against each other to see who is the
true best NBA insider.

I hope you enjoy this, I had a lot of fun learning webscraping while making this.
